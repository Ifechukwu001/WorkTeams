            <h3>Why WorkTeams?</h3>
            <p>
                Do you sometimes feel that you don't meet up to deadlines? That when you come on your laptop to work you end up 
                getting distracted because the goals have not been clearly spelt out? That was us.
            </p>
            <p>
                Fast forward to a month ago. We were to create a solution to a problem for our portfolio project on ALX - Holberton
                software engineering program. We used the opportunity to create a solution to our problem and probably yours - WorkTeams. 
            </p>
            <p>
                WorkTeams is a solution that helps individuals and businesses clearly spell out their goals and the steps required to 
                get to them. It brings about direction and guidiance, as it keeps reminding you of that great idea that you propose 
                to birth.
            </p>
            <p>
                It instills a sense of accountability to the tasks you have before you and to your superiors, while removing the
                distractions along the way.
            </p>
